## Projects

### Raspberry Pi Cluster Home Lab

Leveraging 5x Raspberry Pi 4 Model B's to create a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster for running applications for my own use and learning.

I'm currently in the process of setting up a Kubernetes cluster on the Raspberry Pi's through the use of Ansible and Kubeadm. I am aiming to set up this website and run it on the cluster along with the services mentioned above.

### Raspberry Pi Services

I currently have a number of services running on a single Raspberry Pi through the use of Docker Compose and 1Password (for secret management).

Services running include:
- Traefik (reverse proxy for services and assigns TLS certificates for services through the use of Let's Encrypt and ACME protocol)
- Homepage (dashboard for services)
- Pi-hole
- Homebridge

## Hobbies

üìöÔ∏è I love furthering my knowledge in numerous areas including technology, history, geography, space and all things general knowledge!

üìΩÔ∏è I am a huge lover of films. There are few things I like more than watching a great film and experiencing new ones. Some of my favourite films would be üöÄInterstellar and ‚öîÔ∏è Lord of the Rings. The soundtrack of a film (or any piece of media) for me is a huge part of what makes it truly great!

üèãÔ∏è Maintaining my fitness in my free time by working out, hiking, walking and also the occasional run.

üéÆÔ∏è Video games for me have always been something I've really enjoyed (for similar reasons to films) since I was young. I often find myself revisiting old games I played when I was young for the nostalgia! Some of my childhood favourites would be üêâ Spyro the Dragon, üîß Ratchet and Clank, ü§µ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è James Bond 007: Nightfire and üïëÔ∏è TimeSplitters 2.
